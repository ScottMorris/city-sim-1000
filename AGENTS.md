## Commit Guidelines

- When generating commits, use the Conventional Commits spec.
- Ensure commit messages are clear and descriptive of the changes made.
- Write commit messages in the imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" instead of "fixed bug" or "fixes bug").
- Include body text in commit messages when necessary to provide additional context.

## Tips

- Remember to update the readme or documentation if your changes affect usage or functionality.
- Commits should be atomic; each commit should represent a single logical change or complete context.
- Commit often to avoid large, unwieldy commits.
- Test your changes thoroughly before committing to ensure stability and reliability.

## Canadian English Spelling

Documentation, code comments and variables use Canadian English:

- colour (not color)
- centre (not center)
- licence (not license - noun)
- organise (not organize)
- behaviour (not behavior)
- favour (not favor)

Code identifiers follow web standards (e.g., `color` in CSS, `center` in alignment).
